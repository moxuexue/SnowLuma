// BridgeContext — the protocol-layer surface that anything inside
// @snowluma/bridge (highway uploaders, OIDB envelope helper, element
// builder, msg-push parsers) accepts when it needs `bridge.identity`
// or `bridge.sendRawPacket` plus the upload-metadata cache.
//
// Deliberately apis-less: @snowluma/bridge knows nothing about the
// `apis.<area>.method()` hub that lives in @snowluma/core, so the
// type that bridge code accepts must NOT mention `ApiHub`. The api-
// layer's own extended context (with `apis: ApiHub`) lives at
// @snowluma/core's same-named file and `extends` this one — Api
// classes import from THERE, bridge helpers import from HERE.
//
// The concrete `Bridge` class (in @snowluma/core) implements the
// extended interface, which is a superset of this one. Passing a
// `Bridge` where a slim `BridgeContext` is expected is a free upcast.
